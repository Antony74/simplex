# Simplex

A [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions.

A simplex with the same dimensions as the space where it exists is good for defining solid shapes within that space.  For example triangles within a plane, or tetrahedrons within 3D space.

This is mainly an excuse to experiment with (n+1)-tuples in TypeScript, a simplex having one more point than it has dimensions.
